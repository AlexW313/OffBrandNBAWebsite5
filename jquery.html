    <p id="p1">Wilt Chamberlain's 100-Point Game (Still Unmatched)
        Wilt Chamberlain set an NBA record by scoring 100 points in a single game on March 2, 1962, for the Philadelphia Warriors against the New York Knicks. This is still the highest individual point total in a single game in NBA history, and no player has come close to reaching triple digits since. Chamberlain’s performance remains a monumental feat, reflecting his dominance and the uniqueness of that era in basketball.
        Shortest vs. Tallest Player Matchup
        The NBA saw one of the most visually striking matchups when 5'3" Muggsy Bogues, the shortest player in NBA history, played against 7'7" Manute Bol, one of the tallest players ever. The height difference of over two feet exemplifies the NBA’s diversity in body types and playing styles. Bogues used his speed and agility, while Bol’s height gave him shot-blocking dominance—both finding success despite vastly different statures.
        The 1994 "Double Nickels" Game by Michael Jordan
        After returning from his first retirement in 1995, Michael Jordan scored 55 points against the New York Knicks in Madison Square Garden, known as the "Double Nickels" game. This game proved that Jordan, even after time away from the game, could dominate at the highest level. It helped set the stage for the Chicago Bulls’ second three-peat and is one of the most iconic comeback performances in sports history.
